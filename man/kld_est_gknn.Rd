\title{Generalized nearest-neighbour KL divergence estimation from Wang et al. (2009)}
\usage{
kld_est_gknn(X, Y, max.k = 50, warn.max.k = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X, Y}{\code{n}-by-\code{d} and \code{m}-by-\code{d} matrices, representing \code{n} samples from
the true distribution \eqn{P} and \code{m} samples from the approximate distribution
\eqn{Q}, both in \code{d} dimensions. Vector input is treated as a column matrix.}

\item{max.k}{Maximum numbers of nearest neighbours to compute (default: \code{50}).
A larger \code{max.k} may yield a more accurate KL-D estimate (see \code{warn.max.k}),
but will always increase the computational cost.}

\item{warn.max.k}{If \code{TRUE} (the default), warn if \code{max.k} is such that more
than \code{max.k} neighbours are within the \code{eps} neighbourhood for some data
points. In this case, only the first \code{max.k} neighbours will be counted.
As a consequence, \code{max.k} may required to be increased.}
}
\value{
A scalar, the estimated Kullback-Leibler divergence \eqn{D_{KL}(P||Q)}.
}
\description{
This is the generalized k-NN based KL divergence estimator, eq. (29).
\code{TODO}: more details on the algorithm!
