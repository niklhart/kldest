\title{k-nearest neighbour KL divergence estimator}
\usage{
kld_est_nn(X, Y = NULL, q = NULL, k = 1L, eps = 0.01, log.q = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X, Y}{\code{n}-by-\code{d} and \code{m}-by-\code{d} matrices, representing \code{n} samples from
the true distribution \eqn{P} and \code{m} samples from the approximate distribution
\eqn{Q}, both in \code{d} dimensions. Vector input is treated as a column matrix.
\code{Y} can be left blank if \code{q} is specified (see below).}

\item{q}{The density function of the approximate distribution \eqn{Q}. Either
\code{Y} or \code{q} must be specified.}

\item{k}{The number of nearest neighbours to consider for NN density estimation.
Larger values for \code{k} generally increase bias, but decrease variance of the
estimator. Defaults to \code{k = 1}.}

\item{eps}{Error bound in the nearest neighbour search. A value of \code{eps = 0}
implies exact nearest neighbour search, otherwise approximate nearest
neighbours are sought. Defaults to \code{eps = 0.01}.}

\item{log.q}{If \code{TRUE}, function \code{q} is the log-density rather than the density
of the approximate distribution \eqn{Q} (default: \code{log.q = FALSE}).}
}
\value{
A scalar, the estimated Kullback-Leibler divergence \eqn{D_{KL}(P||Q)}.
}
\description{
This function estimates Kullback-Leibler divergence \eqn{D_{KL}(P||Q)} between
two continuous distributions \eqn{P} and \eqn{Q} using nearest-neighbour (NN)
density estimation in a Monte Carlo approximation of \eqn{D_{KL}(P||Q)}.
}
\details{
Input for estimation is a sample \code{X} from \eqn{P} and either the density
function \code{q} of \eqn{Q} (one-sample problem) or a sample \code{Y} of \eqn{Q}
(two-sample problem). In the two-sample problem, it is the estimator in Eq.(5)
of Wang et al. (2009). In the one-sample problem, the asymptotic bias (the
expectation of a Gamma distribution) is substracted, see Pérez-Cruz (2008),
Eq.(18).
