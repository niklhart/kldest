```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Aim

In this document, I want to evaluate whether a considerable speedup can be 
obtained when using parallelized subsampling.

## Study design

The distribution doesn't matter in this case, so I just stick with a Gaussian.
However, I want to see the dependency on the sample size.
