# Different variants of nearest neighbour Kullback-Leibler divergence estimation

#' k-nearest neighbour KL divergence estimator
#'
#' This function estimates Kullback-Leibler divergence \eqn{D_{KL}(P||Q)} between
#' two continuous distributions \eqn{P} and \eqn{Q} using nearest-neighbour (NN)
#' density estimation in a Monte Carlo approximation of \eqn{D_{KL}(P||Q)}.
#'
#' Input for estimation is a sample `X` from \eqn{P} and either the density
#' function `q` of \eqn{Q} (one-sample problem) or a sample `Y` of \eqn{Q}
#' (two-sample problem). In the two-sample problem, it is the estimator in Eq.(5)
#' of Wang et al. (2009). In the one-sample problem, the asymptotic bias (the
#' expectation of a Gamma distribution) is substracted, see Pérez-Cruz (2008),
#' Eq.(18).

#' @param X,Y  `n`-by-`d` and `m`-by-`d` matrices, representing `n` samples from
#'    the true distribution \eqn{P} and `m` samples from the approximate distribution
#'    \eqn{Q}, both in `d` dimensions. Vector input is treated as a column matrix.
#'    `Y` can be left blank if `q` is specified (see below).
#' @param q The density function of the approximate distribution \eqn{Q}. Either
#'    `Y` or `q` must be specified.
#' @param k The number of nearest neighbours to consider for NN density estimation.
#'    Larger values for `k` generally increase bias, but decrease variance of the
#'    estimator. Defaults to `k = 1`.
#' @param eps Error bound in the nearest neighbour search. A value of `eps = 0`
#'    (the default) implies an exact nearest neighbour search, for `eps > 0`
#'    approximate nearest neighbours are sought, which may be somewhat faster for
#'    high-dimensional problems.
#' @param log.q If `TRUE`, function `q` is the log-density rather than the density
#'    of the approximate distribution \eqn{Q} (default: `log.q = FALSE`).
#' @returns A scalar, the estimated Kullback-Leibler divergence \eqn{\hat D_{KL}(P||Q)}.

#' Bias-reduced generalized k-nearest-neighbour KL divergence estimation
#'
#' This is the bias-reduced generalized k-NN based KL divergence estimator from
#' Wang et al. (2009) specified in Eq.(29).
#'
#' Finite sample bias reduction is achieved by an adaptive choice of the number
#' of nearest neighbours. Instead of fixing the number of nearest neighbours
#' upfront, which results in different distances \eqn{\rho^l_i,\nu^k_i} of a
#' datapoint \eqn{x_i} to its \eqn{l}-th nearest neighbours in \eqn{X} and
#' \eqn{k}-th nearest neighbours in \eqn{Y}, respectively, the number of
#' neighbours \eqn{l,k} is chosen to render \eqn{\rho^l_i,\nu^k_i} comparable.
#' Here, this is done by choosing the maximum number of neighbours \eqn{l,k}
#' smaller than \eqn{\delta_i:=\max(\rho^1_i,\nu^1_i)}.
#'
#' Since the bias reduction explicitly uses both samples `X` and `Y`, one-sample
#' estimation is not possible using this method.

#' @param max.k Maximum numbers of nearest neighbours to compute (default: `100`).
#'    A larger `max.k` may yield a more accurate KL-D estimate (see `warn.max.k`),

#' @param warn.max.k If `TRUE` (the default), warns if `max.k` is such that more
#'    than `max.k` neighbours are within the neighbourhood \eqn{\delta} for some
#'    data point(s). In this case, only the first `max.k` neighbours are counted.
#'    As a consequence, `max.k` may required to be increased.
