The goal of `kldest` is to estimate Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence $D_{KL}(P||Q)$
between two probability distributions $P$ and $Q$ based on:

* a sample $x_1,...,x_n$ from $P$ and the probability density $q$ of $Q$, or
* samples $x_1,...,x_n$ from $P$ and $y_1,...,y_m$ from $Q$.

The distributions $P$ and $Q$ may be uni- or multivariate, and they may be 
discrete, continuous or mixed discrete/continuous.

Different estimation algorithms are provided for continuous distributions, 
either based on nearest neighbour density estimation or kernel density 
estimation. Confidence intervals for KL divergence can also be computed, either 
via subsampling (preferred) or bootstrapping. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of kldest from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("niklhart/kldest")
```

## A minimal example for KL divergence estimation

KL divergence estimation based on nearest neighbour density estimates is the 
most flexible approach.

```{r example}
library(kldest)
```

Set a seed for reproducibility

```{r}
set.seed(0)
```

### KL divergence between 1-D Gaussians

Analytical KL divergence:

```{r}
kld_gaussian(mu1 = 0, sigma1 = 1, mu2 = 1, sigma2 = 2^2)
```

Estimate based on two samples from these Gaussians:

```{r}
X <- rnorm(100)
Y <- rnorm(100, mean = 1, sd = 2)
kld_est_nn(X, Y)
```

Estimate based on a sample from the first Gaussian and the density of the second:

```{r}
q <- function(x) dnorm(x, mean = 1, sd =2)
kld_est_nn(X, q = q)
```

Uncertainty quantification via subsampling:

```{r}
kld_ci_subsampling(X, q = q)
```


### KL divergence between 2-D Gaussians

Analytical KL divergence between an uncorrelated and a correlated Gaussian:

```{r}
kld_gaussian(mu1 = rep(0,2), sigma1 = diag(2),
             mu2 = rep(0,2), sigma2 = matrix(c(1,1,1,2),nrow=2))
```

Estimate based on two samples from these Gaussians:

```{r}
X1 <- rnorm(100)
X2 <- rnorm(100)
Y1 <- rnorm(100)
Y2 <- Y1 + rnorm(100)
X <- cbind(X1,X2)
Y <- cbind(Y1,Y2)

kld_est_nn(X, Y)
```
